# Extended Operators



### Extended Operators

Operators are used when defining conditions and actions in a Rulesheet. While Corticon has a large built-in set of operators, you can expand this set by adding custom operators. Operators can operate on individual attributes, collections or sequences. Examples include:

* Financial functions, such as net present value, and loan amortization
* Statistical functions, such as standard deviation, and permutations
* Engineering functions, such as pi, sine, and cosine
