# Service Callouts

Callouts can be used in a ruleflow to retrieve, modify, or store data that is being processed by the rules. The most common use is to access data in a database or external web service. For example, if your Ruleflow needs to look up an applicant's credit rating, the service callout can have a step in the Ruleflow processing that calls out to a trusted real-time ratings provider, and then adds the response back into the decision processing.
