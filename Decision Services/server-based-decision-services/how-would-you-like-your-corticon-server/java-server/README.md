# Java Environments

The Corticon Server for Java provides the necessary components to deploy Corticon as a REST or SOAP service on a Java application server or to deploy Corticon in-process in your custom Java application. Corticon Server provides installers for both Windows and Linux. The actual deployment artifacts - the JAR and WAR files - are platform independent.
